1. Trading Objectives
Primary Goal: Trade in line with the trend and liquidity cycles to achieve consistent profitability.
Focus: Use Daily Bias, Draw on Liquidity (DOL), and advanced entry patterns to identify high-probability setups.
2. Weekly and Daily Preparation
i)	Weekly Cycle:
•	Day 2 OR (LEVEL A1 SELL SET UP) or (Level V1 BUY SETUP)
•	FRD/FGD
•	INSIDE DAY
•	FALSE BREAK REVERSAL
•	Session 1 higher high
•	Session 2 higher low
•	Session 3 3 pushes into high for false break
•	reversal
•	INSIDE DAY
•	REVERSAL
•	Session 1 1st push
•	Session 2 2nd push
•	Session 3 3 pushes and break in structure and
•	a 123 for the reversal
•	DAY 3 Level A2 SELL SETUP or Level V2 Sell SETUP
•	DAY 3 BREAKOUTS
•	———————————————————————————————————
•	HOD/LOD ( HOM/HOW, LOM/LOW )
•	is high:low locked in?
•	Is session high:low locked in ?tify Key Levels:
•	
o	Previous Day High/Low (PDH/PDL)
o	Yearly High/Low (YH/YL)
o	Average Daily Range (ADR) boundaries
•	Avoid trading against D1 zone flips to align with the higher timeframe trend. 
•	 
•	 
ii)	Daily Pattern:
•	Monitor the daily cycle for potential reversals or continuations.
•	Use the Asian session range as a reference for liquidity sweeps.
  
  
 
📊 3. Bias & Trade Setup
Use this section to determine your daily bias and optimal trade setup based on BTMM and Stacey Burke logic.
Day 2 (Level A1 Sell or Level V1 Buy Setup):
• FRD/FGD (First Red/Green Day)
• Inside Day
• False Break Reversal
• Session 1: Higher high
• Session 2: Higher low
• Session 3: Three pushes into high for false break and reversal
Inside Day Reversal:
• Session 1: 1st push
• Session 2: 2nd push
• Session 3: 3rd push, break in structure, and a 1-2-3 for the reversal
Day 3 (Level A2 Sell or Level V2 Sell Setup):
• Day 3 Breakouts

Bias Checklist:
• HOD/LOD (HOM/HOW, LOM/LOW): Is high/low locked in?
• Is session high/low locked in?

4. Session Timing – (STOP HUNT → TRAP → TRADE)
💡 Practical Tips for Timing
•	⏳ Patience is key: Wait for price to hit key levels at the right time (session open, Brinks times, reversal windows).
•	🚫 Avoid trading during low liquidity: Late Asia session and midday NY session often have erratic price action.
•	✅ Use timing with price action: Confirm entries with candlestick patterns, M/W patterns, or rejection candles during timing windows.

Focus on trading during the following session timings for optimal setups:
Time	Event/Window	Purpose/Use Case
5:00 PM – 12:00 AM	Asian Session	Preparation, low liquidity
2:00 AM – 9:00 AM	London Open	High volatility, reversals, breakouts
9:30 AM – 5:00 PM	New York Open	Major liquidity, trend continuation/reversal
9:30 AM – 10:15 AM	Early NY Reversal Window	Liquidity sweeps, stop hunts
2:00 PM – 3:00 PM	Mid-Afternoon Reversal	Session exhaustion, reversals
9:45 PM	Brinks Trade Timing	Liquidity spike, precise entries
3:45 AM	Brinks Trade Timing	Liquidity spike, precise entries
9:45 AM	Brinks Trade Timing	Liquidity spike, precise entries
a)	Focus on 9PM,1AM,5PM  & 9PM, 3AM, 9AM where we expect movement
i.	915 Multiple different TF traders are active at the same time,
ii.	9PM, 3AM 9PM, THE EQUITY MARKETS OPEN HOUR
b)	“7PM,1AM,7PM” = HOUR BEFORE the 12-candle window – “STOP HUNT”
iii.	DO NOT TAKE TRADE HERE!
i.	33trade - 3 pushes with 123 engulfment’s & pin hammers
ii.	3 LEVELS OF RISE OR 3 LEVELS OF FALL - (DAYS / SESSIONS)
iii.	3 BAR REVERSAL / ENGULFMENT / INSIDE BAR / PIN HAMMER /
